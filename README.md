# Ditto React

`ditto-react` makes it easy to integrate a React app with Ditto.

- Exposes Ditto data to your application through an easy-to-wrap provider
- Offers support for localizing using Ditto variants
- Works hand-in-hand with the [Ditto CLI](https://github.com/dittowords/cli)

Ditto also works with many popular 3rd party i18n libraries. Check out [our demo repository](https://github.com/dittowords/ditto-demo) for an example of how Ditto can be integrated into development using [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

## Installation

You can install `ditto-react` from npm:

```bash
# as a dev dependency
npm install --save-dev ditto-react
```

`ditto-react` comes with TypeScript bindings out of the box.

## Getting Started

### Set up the CLI

First, you'll need to set up the [Ditto CLI](https://github.com/dittowords/cli) in your repository; initialize the CLI in a place that is accessible to your React code.

For example, if you have a project created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), initialize the CLI in the `src` folder, because directories outside of it can't be imported from your application. See the [Ditto CLI's README](https://github.com/dittowords/cli) for more information on how to set it up and start syncing data from your workspace.

### Set up the provider

At the root of your application, import and wrap your app in `DittoProvider`; pass its `source` prop data imported from the `ditto` folder generated by the CLI's `pull` command:

```jsx
import DittoProvider from "ditto-react";
import dittoData from "./ditto";

const App = () => <DittoProvider source={dittoData}>...</DittoProvider>;
```

### Start implementing text components

Anywhere in your application that requires product copy, import and use the `Ditto` component:

```jsx
import { Ditto } from 'ditto-react';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1><Ditto componentId="home.title" /></h1>
    <h2><Ditto componentId="home.subtitle"></h2>
    <p><Ditto componentId="home.body" /></p>
    <footer>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/home"><Ditto componentId="footer.links.home" /></a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/contact"><Ditto componentId="footer.links.contact" /></a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/about"><Ditto componentId="footer.links.about" /></a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </footer>
  </div>
)
```

### Localize with variants

If the components in your Ditto workspace have variants, you can use them in `ditto-react` by passing a `variant` prop to `DittoProvider`. The value of the prop should be equal to the API ID of the variant:

```jsx
import DittoProvider from "ditto-react";
import dittoData from "./ditto";

const options = ["base", "spanish", "korean"];

const App = () => {
  const [variant, setVariant] = useState(options[0]);

  return (
    <DittoProvider source={dittoData} variant={variant}>
      ...
    </DittoProvider>
  );
};
```

## Interpolation

Support dynamic text by passing in variables into your text:

```jsx
<Ditto textId={textId} />
// The cart contains {{itemCount}} {{itemName}}
<Ditto textId={textId} variables={{ itemName: "apples", itemCount: 10 }}/>
// The cart contains 10 apples
<Ditto textId={textId} variables={{ itemName: "pears", itemCount: 6 }}/>
// The cart contains 6 pears
```

Learn how to configure Ditto variables: https://www.dittowords.com/docs/variables

## Plurals

Ditto pluralization can be utilized by passing in the `count` prop:

```jsx
<Ditto textId={textId}/> // The cart contains {{numItems}} items
<Ditto textId={textId} variables={{ numItems: 3 }} count={3}/> // The cart contains 3 items
<Ditto textId={textId} variables={{ numItems: 1 }}count={1}/> // The cart contains 1 item
<Ditto textId={textId} variables={{ numItems: 0 }} count={0}/> // The cart contains no items
```

The `count` prop is indexed to the following plural keys:
| Plural Form | count |
| ---- | ---- |
| zero | 0 |
| one | 1 |
| two | 2 |
| few | 3, 4, 5 |
| many | 6, 7, ..., 99 |
| other | 100, 101, ... |

If the provided `count` value does not fall in the range associated with a defined plural, the 'other' plural form will be used as a default if it is defined. If 'other' is not defined, the base text value will be used as a final fallback.

To configure text plural forms in Ditto, please refer to: https://www.dittowords.com/docs/pluralization

To read more about pluralization and see other examples of how it is used in i18n at large, please refer to the pluralization page in the i18next docs: https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/plurals

## Reference

### DittoProvider

The `DittoProvider` component should wrap all parts of your component tree that will display copy from Ditto.

If `variant` is supplied, base text values will be used as a fallback for any pieces of text where corresponding variant values can't be found.

#### Props

| Prop        | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source`    | JSON (required)   | Copy data imported from the CLI-generated `ditto` folder — see [Source](#Source) for more info                                                                           |
| `variant`   | String (optional) | The API ID of a variant; if specified, all descendant `Ditto` components will attempt to display the value of that variant (requires usage of the `variants` CLI option) |
| `projectId` | String (optional) | The ID of a project in Ditto; can also be ommitted from the provdier and passed as a direct prop to `Ditto` components                                                   |

#### Example

```jsx
import DittoProvider, { Ditto } from "ditto-react";
import source from "./ditto";

<DittoProvider source={source}>{/* the rest of your app */}</DittoProvider>;
```

### Ditto

The `Ditto` component is used for rendering text. Text can be rendered from **components in your component library** (recommended) or from **projects in your workspace**.

Which method you use depends on how you've configured your CLI options. Please refer to the [Ditto CLI](https://github.com/dittowords/cli) and [Ditto Demo](https://github.com/dittowords/ditto-demo) projects for more information.

#### Component Library (recommended)

##### Examples

If you pass `textId`, the specified text string will be rendered:

```jsx
<Ditto
  textId="text_6151fa25151df3024333a8cb"
  projectId="project_613a9b8fd268f614cae17469"
/>
```

If you pass `frameId` and/or `blockId`, the specified frame/block object will be passed to a child function:

```jsx
<Ditto
  frameId="frame_6151fa25151df3024333a8bd"
  blockId="my_block"
  projectId="project_613a9b8fd268f614cae17469"
>
  {(block) =>
    Object.keys(block).map((id) => <div key={block[id]}>{block[id]}</div>)
  }
</Ditto>
```

### Note

In addition to the `<Ditto />` component, individual exports of each specific component type are also available. These behave identically to passing the respective prop configurations to the `<Ditto />` component, but may provide a better experience for TypeScript users due to their improved out-of-the-box type safety and inference:

```js
import {
  DittoFrame,
  DittoBlock,
  DittoText,
  DittoComponent, // rendering components from your Ditto component library
} from "ditto-react";
```

## Additional Examples

### Example: Single Text

The `Ditto` component can be used to fetch a specific text item from the Ditto project using its API ID. Note that you can edit IDs for text, blocks, and frames directly the Ditto web app:

```jsx
<Ditto textId="text_601cc35c5bsdfe42cc3f6f8ac59" />
```

### Example: Fetch Block

You can also fetch an entire Block in Ditto at once by specifying the `frameId` and the `blockId`.

It will return as an entire JSON object of the frame. You can pull out specific IDs of text you'd like to pass to its children.

```jsx
<Ditto frameId="frame_601cc35d5be42cc3f6f8ad15" blockId="hero">
  {({ hero_h1, text_601cc35c5be42cc3f6f8ac46, hero_cta }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{hero_h1}</h1>
      <h2>{text_601cc35c5be42cc3f6f8ac46}</h2>
      <button>{hero_cta}</button>
    </div>
  )}
</Ditto>
```

You can also iterate through the entire block (just as you can with any other object) to display each one.

```jsx
<Ditto frameId="header" blockId="navigation">
  {(block) => {
    return Object.keys(block).map((id) => (
      <div key={block[id]}>{block[id]}</div>
    ));
  }}
</Ditto>
```

### Example: Fetch Frame

You can also fetch an entire Block in Ditto at once by just specifying the `frameId`. With it, you can fetch specific blocks, or iterate through all blocks and containing IDs as needed.

```jsx
<Ditto frameId="frame_601cc35d5be42cc3f6f8ad17">
  {(frame) => {
    return Object.keys(frame.blocks).map((blockId) => (
      <div className={style.footerCol} key={blockId}>
        {Object.keys(frame.blocks[blockId]).map((textId) => (
          <div className={style.link} key={textId}>
            {frame.blocks[blockId][textId]}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    ));
  }}
</Ditto>
```

### Example: Filtering by Tags

If you want to filter the text fetched by properties contained in the project itself, you can specify parameters to the `filter` prop of the `Ditto` component. This currently only supports the Tags field in Ditto, but will be expanded in the future to filter on any other metadata properties.

```jsx
// will only return text with the "TOP_NAV" tag
<Ditto
  frameId="frame_601cc35d5be42cc3f6f8ad15"
  blockId="navigation"
  filters={{ tags: ["TOP_NAV"] }}
>
  {(block) => {
    return Object.keys(block).map((id) => (
      <div className={style.link} key={block[id]}>
        {block[id]}
      </div>
    ));
  }}
</Ditto>
```

## Source

The React provider takes structured JSON outputs from Ditto as the source. These can be linked and automatically updated via [our API/CLI](https://github.com/dittowords/cli), or exported manually via the Ditto web app.

If you're using manual exports from the Ditto web app, turn on Developer Mode in the toolbar of project you're working from to generate API IDs. Then, export your file formatted with the IDs into your local directory .
